Generate a SINGLE commit message strictly following these rules:

MANDATORY RULES:
1. Format: <type>(<scope>)?: <description>
2. TOTAL MAX length: {maxSubjectLength} characters (check before responding)
3. Language: English
4. Structure:
   - Type: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, BREAKING CHANGE
   - Optional scope (only if strictly necessary)
   - ": " (colon + space)
   - Concise description in English

VALID EXAMPLES (<=50 characters):
- feat(auth): add login endpoint
- fix: resolve header overflow
- docs: update api examples

INVALID EXAMPLES:
- "feat: add new login system with email validation" (too long)
- "fix: bug" (too vague)

REQUEST:
Analyze this diff and generate ONLY the commit message (no additional comments) that:
1. Follows the format above EXACTLY
2. Is <=50 characters
3. CONCISELY describes the changes
